### Hi there 👋

Hi there! I'm Gui. I'm a Full Stack Typescript Engineer from Lisbon, Portugal 🌞, currently working at DataCamp.

When I'm not working, I am fully focused in raising my baby daughter 🍼👶🏻🐣💖. Besides being interested about programming and tech in general, I'm a home cook 👨‍🍳 I love cooking and baking and I considered changing careers more times than I'd like to admit.
And since I can't avoid being a nerd on the subjects that interest me the most, I'm also an aviation geek, specialty coffee enthusiast and sourdough afficionado.

In any case, here's a little about what I've done in the past:

- 🎨 Developed and maintained several frontend web apps, from Angular to Next.js and React
- 🕸️ Worked on GraphQL APIs using Apollo Server and Nexusjs, as well as REST APIs using NestJS, Express, Koa and other libraries
- 📦 Designed and maintained databases using different technologies, ranging from SQL, no-SQL and graph databases
- 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Led teams, conducted code reviews and coached junior engineers

If you have any questions, send me a message!
